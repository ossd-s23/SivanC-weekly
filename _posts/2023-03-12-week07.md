title: "Week 7: Group Work on Major Project"
---

This week my partner and I picked a project to work on for the remainder of the
semester. We chose Open Library, and I hope that it will be a fun and valuable
project for us to contribute to.

## Project Selection

My partner and I chose the Open Library project, which is run by the Internet
Archive. We chose this project partially because our interests did not align in
other areas, and also because we were both motivated by this project and it has
a welcoming and contributor-friendly community. Our group work session was
productive, as we laid out our hopes for progress over next week, as well as
took a deeper look at the Open Library code repository and try to think about
which sections of the project we might want to take on. 

## Hopes and Worries

Some worries I have for the project are that me and my partner might have
different interests in terms of which areas of the project we would like to
focus on, or that it will take us a while to understand the project and narrow
down a good issue/feature to work on.

Some hopes I have are that we will be able to make strong connections with the
Open Library community and find an impactful and appropriately-sized project to
work on within Open Library. I also hope that my partner and I are able to find
effective and efficient ways to communicate and collaborate.
