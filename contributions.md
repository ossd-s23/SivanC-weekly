| February 22 | [my contribution](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim/issues/275#issuecomment-1440155323) | Github Project | Did some more digging and found the content within the patch that broke the plugin where the error is occuring, and the place in the plugin where the error is being triggered. Forked the plugin repo to try some changes but haven't found the solution yet, hoping for a vimscript guru to come down from the sky and teach me how to interpret this incomprehensible scripting language |

The diff link does not show that I also added a substantial description as taken from the back of the book, in addition to the other information shown as changed. |
| February 26 | [my contribution](https://imgur.com/MGq3eJY) | Open Library | Filled out a form to request merging of several author pages for the author Yu Hua 余华. I don't know how to link the actual response I sent until they reply to me, so I've just uploaded this picture for now of their confirmation, but I will update if they get back to me or if my changes are implemented. |
| March 4 | [my contribution](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim/issues/275#issuecomment-1454390899) | Github Project | Asked for some more information as a follow up to my last comment, but looks like I was beat to the solution by the maintainer unfortunately! |
